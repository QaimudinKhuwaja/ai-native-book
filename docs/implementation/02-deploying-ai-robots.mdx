# Deploying AI Robots

Deploying embodied AI systems from the laboratory into real-world production environments presents unique challenges. Unlike software systems that can be instantly rolled back, physical robots operate in uncontrolled environments where failures can have significant consequences.

## Pre-Deployment Preparation

### System Validation

#### Functionality Testing
- All core capabilities working as designed
- Edge case handling verified
- Error conditions properly handled
- Safety systems validated

#### Performance Metrics
- Task success rates meeting targets
- Operating speeds acceptable
- Power consumption within limits
- Reliability metrics established

#### Stress Testing
- Extended operation without failure
- Handling of degraded sensors
- Recovery from failures
- Boundary condition handling

### Environmental Assessment
- Characterizing the deployment environment
- Identifying potential hazards
- Planning mitigation strategies
- Establishing safe operating procedures

## Deployment Strategies

### Phased Rollout
Rather than deploying all systems at once:

1. **Pilot Deployment**: Single robot in limited scope
2. **Monitoring and Learning**: Understand real-world performance
3. **Scaling**: Additional robots following learnings
4. **Optimization**: Continuous improvement based on data

### Shadowing Phase
- Robots operate alongside human workers
- Humans can intervene if needed
- Learning human workflows and preferences
- Building trust and confidence

### Gradual Autonomy
- Start with significant human oversight
- Gradually increase autonomous decision-making
- Retain human ability to take control
- Clear communication of robot state

## Real-World Challenges

### Environmental Variability
- Lighting conditions changing
- Object arrangements not seen in training
- Weather and temperature variations
- Unexpected obstacles and hazards

### Sensor Degradation
- Cameras getting dirty or fogged
- Wear on mechanical sensors
- Loose connections and aging components
- Calibration drift over time

### Software Issues
- Bugs in deployed code
- Unforeseen edge cases
- Interaction effects between subsystems
- Model performance degradation

### Unpredictable Human Behavior
- Humans acting in unexpected ways
- Miscommunication between human and robot
- Safety violations by human workers
- Conflicting goals and priorities

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time tracking of key metrics
- Anomaly detection for unusual behavior
- Data logging for offline analysis
- Alert systems for critical issues

### Preventive Maintenance
- Regular sensor calibration
- Component inspection and replacement
- Software updates and patches
- Lubrication and mechanical service

### Reactive Maintenance
