# DevOps for AI-Native Systems

DevOps principles are extended and adapted for AI-Native systems, forming a crucial part of the operational framework. The focus shifts to automating not just software delivery, but also the continuous integration, delivery, and deployment of intelligent components.

## Core Concepts

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Integrating code changes and AI model updates frequently and automatically.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automatically preparing code and models for release to production.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploying code and models to production after successful testing.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure (compute, storage, networking for AI workloads) using code.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Using Docker and Kubernetes for packaging and managing AI applications.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring for application and AI model performance, and collecting detailed logs.

## Challenges in AI-Native DevOps

- **Model Drift**: AI models can degrade over time; monitoring and retraining pipelines are essential.
- **Data Dependencies**: AI deployments are tightly coupled with data pipelines.
- **Resource Management**: Managing GPU resources and specialized hardware for AI workloads.
- **Ethical AI**: Ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability throughout the AI lifecycle.
