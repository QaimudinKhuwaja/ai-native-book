# MLOps for AI-Native Systems

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to deploy and maintain ML systems in production reliably and efficiently. For AI-Native systems, MLOps is foundational.

## Key Pillars of AI-Native MLOps

- **Automated ML Pipelines**: Automating the entire ML lifecycle, from data ingestion to model deployment.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Managing and tracking various ML experiments, models, and their metrics.
- **Model Versioning**: Storing and managing different versions of trained models.
- **Model Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring model performance, data drift, and concept drift in production.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that ML experiments and deployments can be reproduced consistently.
- **Data Governance**: Integrating data quality and governance into ML pipelines.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, Weights & Biases
- **Orchestration**: Kubeflow, Apache Airflow
- **Model Serving**: Seldon Core, TensorFlow Serving
- **Feature Stores**: Feast, Hopsworks
- **Data Versioning**: DVC (Data Version Control)
