# What is AI-Native Driven Development?

AI-Native Driven Development is a paradigm that places artificial intelligence at the core of the software development lifecycle. Instead of AI being an add-on feature, it is an intrinsic part of the application's design, architecture, and operational model. This approach aims to build systems that are inherently intelligent, adaptive, and capable of autonomous learning and decision-making.

## Key Characteristics

- **AI-First Design**: AI components are not retrofitted but are foundational to the system's purpose.
- **Data-Centric**: Data pipelines, governance, and quality are paramount, driving AI model development and refinement.
- **Continuous Learning**: Systems are designed for constant improvement through feedback loops from real-world interactions.
- **Autonomous Operations**: Leveraging AI for self-healing, self-optimizing, and self-managing capabilities.
- **Cloud-Native Principles**: Adopting microservices, containers, and serverless architectures to provide scalability and resilience for AI workloads.
