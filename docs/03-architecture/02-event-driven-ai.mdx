# Event-Driven AI Architectures

Event-driven architectures (EDA) are highly complementary to AI-Native Driven Development, especially for real-time AI applications. By reacting to events, AI systems can become more responsive, scalable, and resilient.

## Core Concepts

- **Events**: Immutable records of something that happened in the system.
- **Event Producers**: Components that publish events.
- **Event Consumers**: Components that subscribe to and process events (e.g., AI models for real-time inference).
- **Event Brokers**: Infrastructure (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) that facilitates event communication.

## AI Applications in EDA

- **Real-time Personalization**: AI models consume user interaction events to provide instant recommendations.
- **Fraud Detection**: AI models analyze transaction events in real-time to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
- **Anomaly Detection**: AI models monitor system events to identify unusual patterns that might indicate issues.
- **Continuous Learning**: Events from real-world interactions can be fed back into AI model training pipelines for continuous improvement.

## Benefits

- **Decoupling**: Producers and consumers are unaware of each other, leading to flexible and scalable architectures.
- **Responsiveness**: AI models can react to events in near real-time.
- **Scalability**: Event brokers can handle high volumes of events.
- **Resilience**: Systems can gracefully handle failures as events can be reprocessed.
