# AI-Native Architectural Patterns

AI-Native architectures are fundamentally different from traditional software architectures. They are characterized by loose coupling, distributed components, and data-centric design. Here are some key patterns:

## Microservices for AI

- **Decomposition**: Breaking down monolithic AI applications into smaller, independent, and domain-specific services.
- **Specialization**: Each microservice can encapsulate a specific AI model or a set of related AI functionalities.
- **Scalability**: Individual microservices can be scaled independently based on their AI workload demands.
- **Technology Diversity**: Teams can choose the best-fit AI frameworks and tools for each microservice.

## Event-Driven Architectures

- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services communicate via events, enabling loose coupling and resilience.
- **Real-time Processing**: Ideal for handling high-throughput data streams and real-time AI inference.
- **Decoupled Data**: Event streams act as a source of truth, allowing different services to consume data at their own pace.
- **Scalability and Responsiveness**: Event brokers can handle large volumes of events, ensuring responsiveness even under heavy load.
